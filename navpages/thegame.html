        <h2>The Game</h2>
        <p>
            I played a lot games these years and I am eager to express my idea of making a game. I want to make a game
            that is serious, rich in story and can reflect on real life. So the player will resonate with the game.
            About the story, there are a few selections among politics, culture shock, family and self-consciousness. I
            can't talk too much about this as it's still in concept phase.
